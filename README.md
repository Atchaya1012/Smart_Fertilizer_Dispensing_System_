# Smart Fertilizer Dispensing System

# Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent system for recommending suitable fertilizers based on environmental and soil conditions. 
Using machine learning models, the system predicts the best fertilizer type for a given set of parameters, such as temperature, humidity, moisture, soil type, and crop type. 
The project integrates MongoDB for data storage and TensorFlow for model training.

# Features
=> Machine Learning-Based Fertilizer Prediction: Uses deep learning and traditional ML models to recommend the best fertilizer.
=> Data Storage & Retrieval: Utilizes MongoDB to store and manage agricultural datasets.
=> Data Preprocessing & Visualization: Implements encoding, scaling, and correlation heatmaps for better insights.
=> Model Performance Evaluation: Trains and evaluates models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

# Technologies Used
=> Python – Primary programming language
=> TensorFlow/Keras – Neural network model implementation
=> Scikit-learn – Machine learning model training and evaluation
=> MongoDB – Database for storing and retrieving agricultural data
=> Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

# Project Outcome
=> The project successfully predicts suitable fertilizers based on environmental and soil conditions.
=> By leveraging ML models, it helps optimize fertilizer usage, leading to better crop yield and resource efficiency. 
=> The system can be further expanded to integrate real-time data for enhanced recommendations.
